    """Rank recipes by how well they fit the request's nutrient targets.

    Each recipe is scored against a per-meal target derived from the request's
    nutrient goals (or limit midpoints when no goal is given). The score is a
    negative sum of normalised deviations, so higher is better. The list is
    returned sorted by descending score, then ascending ``recipe_id``, and
    truncated to a bounded pool size suitable for the CP-SAT solver.
